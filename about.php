                    <blockquote>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">While traditionally Himachal was known as a summer destination,
                            the Department of Tourism &amp; Civil Aviation has taken special efforts to break the
                            seasonality factor and has developed diversified tourism products to attract tourists in
                            other seasons too. Now Himachal is known as “A Destination for All Seasons and All Reasons”.
                            In fact, the Department has laid a special emphasis on the development of activity-based
                            tourism and opening up of new sub destinations. To promote tourism in the countryside and to
                            unexplored areas, appropriate infrastructure is being developed within available resources.
                            By focussing on quality tourists, the Department aims at promoting sustainable tourism and
                            encouraging private sector to develop tourism related infrastructure in the State without
                            disturbing the existing ecology and environment.</p>
